This repository demonstrates a common ActionScript 3 error: the null object reference error.  The error occurs when trying to access a property or method of an object that is currently null. This example focuses on updating a display object's text property. The solution shows how to properly check for null before accessing the property.  The `bug.as` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.as` provides the corrected version.
